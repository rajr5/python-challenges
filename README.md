# Python Challenges

Solutions are grouped into directories, each one has:

- `main.py` example using the solution
- `[solution_name].py` containing the solution to the problem
- `[solution_name].test.py` a couple of unit tests to present the solutions are working fine

Since file_sort is a bit less of an algoritmic problem and it's long running, it's not really feasible for testing.

## Python version

The code was written and tested with Python 3.7


## Unit tests

The solutions are tested via Python's unittest framework to make sure the everything works properly.
